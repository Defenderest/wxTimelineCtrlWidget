 Welcome to the official API reference documentation for the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classwxTimelineCtrl}{wx\+Timeline\+Ctrl}} component.

This reference provides a detailed, technical overview of all the classes, methods, and data structures that constitute the component. It is intended for developers who wish to integrate {\ttfamily \doxylink{classwxTimelineCtrl}{wx\+Timeline\+Ctrl}} into their own projects or contribute to its development.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{What is wx\+Timeline\+Ctrl?}{What is wxTimelineCtrl?}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
{\ttfamily \doxylink{classwxTimelineCtrl}{wx\+Timeline\+Ctrl}} is a flexible and interactive C++ control for the wx\+Widgets framework, designed for visualizing time-\/based data. It is ideally suited for applications such as\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Video and audio editors
\item Project management tools with Gantt charts
\item Event schedulers and data log visualizers

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Templated Design\+:}} The control is a template ({\ttfamily template\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}typename T\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}), allowing it to work with any user-\/defined data structure that inherits from {\ttfamily \doxylink{classTimelineItemData}{Timeline\+Item\+Data}}.
\item {\bfseries{Interactive Controls\+:}} It supports smooth zooming, panning, as well as item dragging and resizing.
\item {\bfseries{Dual-\/\+View Navigation\+:}} It features a detailed main timeline view and a full-\/range scroller for quick navigation across the entire time span.
\item {\bfseries{Customizable Drawing\+:}} The entire look and feel can be customized by inheriting from the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classTimelineArtProvider}{Timeline\+Art\+Provider}} class.
\item {\bfseries{Event-\/\+Driven Architecture\+:}} It integrates easily with application logic through a rich set of {\ttfamily wx\+Command\+Event}s.

To work effectively with this reference, we recommend exploring the following sections\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\bfseries{Class}} {\ttfamily \doxylink{classwxTimelineCtrl}{wx\+Timeline\+Ctrl}} is the main entry point and primary class of the component. Its documentation contains a "{}quick start"{} code example for basic setup.
\item The {\bfseries{Classes}} tab in the top navigation bar provides a complete alphabetical list of all classes in the library.
\item The {\bfseries{Files}} tab provides access to the documentation for each source file, which is useful for understanding the project\textquotesingle{}s structure.
